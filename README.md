# BeatSaber_OffsetFixer

This plugin is similar to JDFixer/NJSFixer/EasyRT, but allow the player to set a specific offset based on BPM instead.  
This specific offset is calculated with this formula: beat duration * (jump / precision).  
The spawn offset is not affected by NJS and overwrite JD and RT.  
This is similar to using the base game offset setting, but better and more precise.  
  
You can configure the jump and precision in the gameplay config menu.
  
Plugin Requirement:
- BS_Utils
- BSML
